					All attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers at DC
					State of the Stack are required to agree with the following
					code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code
					throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all

					everybody.

					The Quick Version
				</h2>
				<p>
					Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free
					conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender,
					gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation,
					disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity,
					religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not
					tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.
					Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any
					conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties,
					Twitter, and other online media. Conference participants
					violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the
					conference without a refund at the discretion of the
					conference organizers.

					<p>
						Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to
						gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
						orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
						race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual
						images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation,
						stalking, following, harassing photography or recording,
						sustained disruption of talks or other events,
						inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
						attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing
						behavior are expected to comply immediately.
					</p>

					<p>
						Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy.
						In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized
						images, activities, or other material. Booth staff
						(including volunteers) should not use sexualized
						clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a
						sexualized environment.
					</p>

					<p>
						If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the
						conference organizers may take any action they deem
						appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion
						from the conference with no refund.
					</p>

					<p>
						If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is
						being harassed, or have any other concerns, please
						contact a member of conference staff immediately.
					</p>

					<p>
						Conference staff can be identified by distinct staff
						badges. Conference staff will be happy to help
						participants contact hotel/venue security or local law
						enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those
						experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of
						the conference. We value your attendance.
					</p>

					<p>
						We expect participants to follow these rules at
						conference and workshop venues and conference-related
						social events.
